# REM Accessibility

This is an example for using `rem` as a font size, or other sizes with the 62.5% font base font size trick.

It also has a couple of `mixins` to help converting a `px` unit to a `rem` unit.

Look in the `styles.scss` file for the use case example, and the `mixins` can be found in the `mixins` folder.

## Initial set up

nvm use && yarn && yarn dev
